## Description

This store provides the touched status of a field, or group of fields under a single `name` property.

On form creation every form field is assigned a `focus` handler. The touched status for the group `name` is also set to `false`.

When the user clicks or tabs on to the field the store is updated to reflect the `name` as `true`.
All of the `focus` handlers for the group and then immediately removed, so this group will no longer update the status.

## Example

```svelte
<script>
  import { formula } from 'svelte-formula';
  const { form, touched } = formula();
</script>
<form use:form>
  <label for='text-input'>Text Input</label>
  <input type='text' required id='text-input' name='textvalue' />
  <span hidden={!touched?.textvalue}>This field has been activted by the user</span>
</form>
```
